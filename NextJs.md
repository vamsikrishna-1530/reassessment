To reach an **intermediate level in Next.js**, you should focus on:  

### **1️⃣ Core Next.js Features**  
✅ **File-based Routing** → Understand how pages are created using the `pages/` directory.  
✅ **Dynamic Routing** → Learn `[id].js` for dynamic routes and `[...slug].js` for catch-all routes.  
✅ **API Routes** → Handle backend logic within Next.js using `pages/api/`.  
✅ **Built-in CSS & Styling** → Use global styles, CSS modules, and Tailwind with Next.js.  

---

### **2️⃣ Rendering Strategies**  
✅ **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** → Similar to React but affects SEO.  
✅ **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** → Fetch data at request time for SEO and real-time updates.  
✅ **Static Site Generation (SSG)** → Pre-build pages at build time for better performance.  
✅ **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** → Revalidate static pages on demand for dynamic content.  

---

### **3️⃣ Performance Optimization**  
✅ **Image Optimization** → Use `next/image` for automatic lazy loading and resizing.  
✅ **Code Splitting** → Next.js automatically splits code for better performance.  
✅ **Prefetching** → Next.js preloads pages when users hover over links (`next/link`).  
✅ **Middleware** → Run custom logic before processing requests (useful for authentication).  

---

### **4️⃣ Deployment & Best Practices**  
✅ **Deploy on Vercel** → Official Next.js hosting for seamless deployment.  
✅ **Env Variables** → Secure API keys using `.env.local`.  
✅ **Caching & Revalidation** → Use `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` for optimized content updates.  
✅ **Middleware & Authentication** → Implement session handling with **NextAuth.js**.
