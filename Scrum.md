### **Understanding Scrum Concepts: Capacity, Velocity, and Estimation Techniques**  

#### **1️⃣ Capacity in Scrum**
Capacity refers to the **team's availability and workload handling ability** during a sprint. It is measured in:  
- **Hours** (total available working hours of team members).  
- **Story points** (if using relative estimation).  

🔹 **Factors Affecting Capacity:**  
✔ Team member availability (vacations, meetings, etc.).  
✔ Sprint duration (e.g., 2-week sprint).  
✔ Unexpected work (support tickets, bug fixes).  

🔹 **Why It Matters?**  
✅ Helps in **realistic sprint planning** (avoids overcommitting).  
✅ Ensures **team workload balance** (avoids burnout).

#### **2️⃣ Velocity in Scrum**
Velocity is the **average amount of work a team completes per sprint** (measured in story points).  

🔹 **How to Calculate Velocity?**  
✔ Add up the total story points completed in the last 3–5 sprints.  
✔ Take the average = **team's velocity**.  

🔹 **Why It Matters?**  
✅ Helps **predict future sprint commitments**.  
✅ Provides **data-driven insights** for release planning.  
✅ Improves **sprint predictability**.

#### **3️⃣ Estimation Techniques in Scrum**
Estimations help teams **assess the effort needed** for tasks. Common techniques include:  

🔹 **1. Planning Poker** (Most Popular)  
✔ Team assigns story points using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…).  
✔ Encourages discussion & prevents bias.  

🔹 **2. T-Shirt Sizing**  
✔ Uses simple categories: **XS, S, M, L, XL**.  
✔ Good for quick, high-level estimations.  

🔹 **3. Bucket System**  
✔ Stories are sorted into predefined effort "buckets" (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.).  
✔ Used for large backlog refinement sessions.  

🔹 **4. Dot Voting**  
✔ Team members vote on story effort by placing dots on options.  
✔ Quick way to **gain team consensus**.  

🔹 **5. Affinity Mapping**  
✔ Team groups stories **based on complexity**.  
✔ Ideal for **new teams** unfamiliar with story points.

✅ **Velocity → Helps predict future delivery timelines.**  
✅ **Estimation Techniques → Help plan work efficiently.**
