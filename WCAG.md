Certainly! Here's how you can answer **"Can you explain how you’ve implemented accessibility (a11y) in your projects as per WCAG standards?"** — as a **candidate** in a real interview setting:

### 🧑‍💼 **Candidate Answer:**

> Yes, accessibility is something I actively prioritize in all my frontend projects, especially since many users rely on assistive technologies. In my most recent project — a multi-page insurance form built using **Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** — I implemented accessibility based on **WCAG 2.1 AA standards**.
>
> I made sure to use **semantic HTML** elements, like `<button>`, `<form>`, and `<section>`, to provide clear meaning for screen readers. For example, all inputs were paired with proper `<label>` tags using `htmlFor` and `aria-describedby` for error messages.
>
> I also focused heavily on **keyboard navigation** — ensuring that all interactive components were accessible using just Tab, Enter, and Space. Tailwind helped me style visible focus indicators using `focus:outline` utilities.
>
> To meet **color contrast** standards, I used the **WebAIM contrast checker** and avoided combinations that didn't meet the 4.5:1 ratio. We also added skip links and used landmark roles like `<main>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` to help screen reader users navigate easily.
>
> Additionally, I ran automated audits using **Axe DevTools** and **Lighthouse** in Chrome DevTools. We treated a11y issues as part of our bug backlog, and they were included in our Definition of Done.
>
> Overall, this made the form not just accessible for users with disabilities, but also more usable and robust for everyone. And since the role I’m applying for is customer-facing, I believe accessibility is a critical aspect of delivering high-quality, inclusive experiences.
