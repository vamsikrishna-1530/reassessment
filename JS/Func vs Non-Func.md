# Functional vs Non-Functional in Web Development

Functional and non-functional requirements play significant roles in defining the intended behavior and performance of a web application. Understanding the differences between the two categories helps developers design and build high-quality web applications.

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the features and capabilities that a web application must have to serve its intended purpose. These requirements specify the expected behavior, such as what the application should do when users interact with it.

### Examples of Functional Requirements

- User registration and authentication
- Data input validation and error handling
- Search functionality with filtering and sorting
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are concerned with the characteristics of a web application that influence its performance, usability, security, and other aspects unrelated to its core features. These requirements typically cover qualities that enhance the end-user experience or ensure the application's long-term viability.

### Examples of Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Load times, response times, and resource usage
- Scalability: Ability to handle growth in the number of users or increased operations
- Usability: User-friendliness, intuitiveness, and accessibility
- Security: Protection of user data, confidentiality, and secure communication
- Maintainability: Ease of updating, testing, and fixing issues in the codebase

In web development, being mindful of functional and non-functional requirements helps guide decision-making during the design and implementation phases. Striving for a balance between the two leads to applications that not only meet their intended objectives but also offer a positive user experience and stand the test of time.


Sure, let's go through how this question might be handled in an interview setting:

**Interviewer:**
Can you discuss your experience with implementing both functional and non-functional requirements in your projects?

**Candidate:**
Certainly! I have worked extensively with both functional and non-functional requirements in my role as a JavaScript Frontend Developer. Let me break it down:

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Implemented core functionalities such as user authentication, form validation, and dynamic content rendering.
   
2. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Developed interactive and responsive UIs using frameworks like React and Vue.js.
   
3. **API Integration**:
   - Integrated RESTful APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance**:
   - Optimized loading times by code splitting and lazy loading of components.
   - Utilized web workers and caching strategies to enhance performance.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Structured the codebase using modular patterns and followed best practices to ensure the application could scale easily.
   
3. **Usability**:
   - Ensured the application met usability standards by conducting user testing and iterating on user feedback.
   
4. **Security**: 
   - Implemented measures such as XSS protection, CSRF tokens, and secure handling of user sessions.
   
5. **Accessibility**:
   - Followed WAI-ARIA guidelines to ensure the application was accessible to users with disabilities.

By integrating both functional and non-functional requirements into my projects, I ensure that the applications are not only feature-rich but also performant, secure, and user-friendly.
