### Interviewer:
Great, I'd like to talk about some differences between `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, and `setImmediate`. Could you explain these three functions and highlight the key differences?

### Candidate:
Absolutely! Let's start with defining each one:

1. **`setTimeout`**:
   - This function is used to execute a callback function after a specified number of milliseconds.
   - **Usage:** When you want to run a piece of code once after a delay.
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
   }, 2000);
   ```

2. **`setInterval`**:
   - This function is used to repeatedly execute a callback function at specified intervals in milliseconds.
   - **Usage:** When you want to run a piece of code repeatedly at defined time intervals.
   ```javascript
   setInterval(() => {
     console.log("This runs every 2 seconds");
   }, 2000);
   ```

3. **`setImmediate`** (specific to Node.js):
   - This function is used to execute a callback function immediately after the current event loop iteration completes.
   - **Usage:** When you need to run some code right after the current event loop phase completes but before any I/O operations.
   ```javascript
   setImmediate(() => {
     console.log("This runs immediately after the current event loop");
   });
   ```

### Key Differences:
- **Timing:**
  - `setTimeout` runs code after at least the specified delay (assuming the timer can be triggered).
  - `setInterval` runs code repeatedly with a delay between each execution.
  - `setImmediate` runs code at the end of the current event loop, before any I/O events (Node.js specific).

- **Use Cases:**
  - **`setTimeout`:** Useful for one-time delayed execution, like delayed animations or delayed function calls.
  - **`setInterval`:** Useful for continuous polling or repeated actions, such as updating clocks or periodic data fetching.
  - **`setImmediate`:** Useful for deferring code that needs to run right after the current execution stack without waiting for pending I/O operations.

### Example:
Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate how they each work differently:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout');
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('setImmediate');
});

setInterval(() => {
  console.log('setInterval');
  clearInterval(); // Clear interval to only see it once for this example
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

### Expected Output:
```
Start
End
setImmediate
setTimeout
setInterval
```

- **Reason:**
  - The synchronous logs (`Start` and `End`) execute first.
  - `setImmediate` is part of the event loop's check phase and runs before `setTimeout`.
  - `setTimeout` runs in the timer phase of the event loop.
  - `setInterval` sets up repeating code, we'll clear it on the first run for this demonstration.

I hope this clarifies the differences!

### Interviewer:
Excellent explanation! Thank you for laying it out so clearly and providing the code example for better understanding.
