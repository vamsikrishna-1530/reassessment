**Introduction:**  
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,  

I’m **Vamsi Krishna**, and I’m excited to be here today to share my journey, experiences, and contributions throughout my career. With over **7 years of experience in IT** — including **2.11 years at EPAM Systems** — I’ve had the privilege of working on **three major projects** for the same client as a **key front-end developer**. During this time, I was honored to receive the **Customer Focus badge**, which reflects my dedication to delivering impactful solutions with a user-first mindset.  

### **Professional Background and Core Competencies:**  
My primary expertise lies in **Front-end Development**, specifically with **JavaScript** and **React.js**. Over the years, I’ve built strong proficiency in:  
- **React, Redux, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML, and CSS** for robust UI development.  
- Frameworks and libraries like **Kendo-UI, Material UI**, and **Next.js**.  
- **CI/CD pipelines**, **unit testing** with **Jest and React Testing Library**, and **SDLC best practices**.  
- **Node.js** for server-side scripting and backend integration.  
- Hands-on experience with **Agile methodologies**, specifically **Scrum** and **Kanban**, for efficient project management.  

I’m constantly refining my skills, particularly in areas like **adaptability, web performance optimization, and software engineering principles**, to stay aligned with industry standards.

### **Key Project Contributions:**  

#### **1. Previous Project – Phenom People:**  
At Phenom People, I played a crucial role in **developing and integrating career websites** with leading ATS systems such as **Workday, Taleo, and Bullhorn**, resulting in a **30% boost** in user engagement.  
Through this project, I gained significant experience in:  
- **Application state management** with **Redux** and leveraging **React Hooks** for functional components.  
- Writing clean, high-quality code while adhering to the project’s style guidelines and participating in regular **code reviews**.  
- Implementing **unit testing** to ensure high code reliability.  
- Adapting to the **Agile process**, working collaboratively in sprint planning and backlog grooming sessions.  

One of my most notable achievements in this project was conducting a **performance analysis** and applying **optimization techniques**, such as **lazy loading** and using **pure components**, which improved the overall efficiency of the web application by **20%**.

### **2. Current Project – EDM, EPAM Systems (Client: S&P Global):**  
Currently, I’m part of the **EDM** project — a data management platform that provides transparency and trust in data by acquiring, validating, and distributing operational and financial data. My role primarily focuses on:  
- Taking **ownership of the UI development process** and creating **generic, reusable React components**.  
- **Integration with GraphQL APIs** and building services to manage data flow efficiently.  
- Maintaining high **unit test coverage** with Jest and ensuring **code quality** through **SonarQube**.  
- Developing various user interface components, such as **Grid**, **Charts**, **Accordion**, and **Drawer**, while adhering to **WCAG and ADA standards** for accessibility.  
- Actively contributing during sprint planning for **task clarification and decomposition**.  
- Mentoring and guiding **junior developers**, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.  

One of my proudest achievements on this project was identifying potential challenges early on, which ensured the **timely delivery of high-quality, error-free UI components**.

### **Addressing Identified Gaps & Continuous Learning:**  
In addition to my project work, I’m passionate about continuous improvement and self-development. Over the past year, I’ve focused on:  
- **Adaptability:** Enhancing problem resolution by improving estimation accuracy, acceptance criteria, and QA processes.  
- **Software Engineering Practices:** Applying code standards, managing technical debt, and following the **F.I.R.S.T.** principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-verifying, Timely).  
- **TypeScript:** Strengthening my understanding of advanced features, such as the differences between **any** and **unknown** types, and the use of **interfaces**.  
- **Node.js:** Developing **mock services**, understanding the **event loop**, and handling **asynchronous operations**.  
- **Web Communication Protocols:** Exploring techniques such as **polling, SSE, WebSocket**, and reconnection handling.  
- **Software Design & Web Performance:** Optimizing with **CDNs, preloading, prefetching**, and caching, while evaluating libraries based on **bundle size, community support, and version stability**.  
- **Git & CI/CD Processes:** Improving branching strategies, understanding **merge vs. rebase**, and recognizing the **impact of CI/CD pipelines**.  
- **Testing:** Strengthening knowledge of the **test pyramid**, focusing on integration and **E2E testing**.  
- **Scrum Methodologies:** Deepening understanding of capacity planning, velocity, and estimation techniques.

### **Non-Project Contributions:**  
Outside of project work, I actively engage in non-project activities to broaden my technical perspective:  
- Participating in weekly **quiz activities** to stay updated with the latest technologies.  
- Attending **NSA tech talks** on various aspects of technology, enhancing my adaptability.  
- Engaging in **Clean As You Code** campaigns, which has given me valuable insights into writing efficient code.  
- Taking part in **Agile Thinking** sessions to better understand **backlog grooming**, **user story splitting**, and **continuous delivery** practices.

### **Closing:**  
To sum up, my journey has been about continuous growth — from honing core technical skills to actively contributing to team success and striving for excellence. I’m passionate about building impactful solutions and continuously learning to improve my craft.  

I’m looking forward to discussing my experiences, answering any questions you may have, and receiving feedback that can help me grow further.  

**Thank you!**
