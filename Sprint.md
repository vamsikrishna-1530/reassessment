# **Sprint Roles**

**Candidate:** Absolutely! In a Scrum team, there are three key roles:

1. **Product Owner:** The Product Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product and prioritizing the product backlog. They ensure that the team is working on the most important and valuable tasks. They act as the voice of the customer, balancing stakeholder interests and business goals.

2. **Scrum Master:** The Scrum Master serves as a facilitator and coach for the Scrum team. They help the team adhere to Scrum practices and principles, remove any impediments that may hinder progress, and foster an environment of continuous improvement. The Scrum Master also ensures that the team follows the agreed-upon processes and ceremonies such as sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

3. **Development Team:** The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint. This team is typically cross-functional, including developers, testers, designers, and other specialists as required. Everyone in the Development Team works collaboratively, shares responsibility for the project, and is accountable for delivering the product increment.

# **Sprint Activities**

**Interviewer:** That’s a comprehensive explanation! Could you also talk about how these roles interact with each other during a sprint?

**Candidate:** Certainly! During a sprint, the roles interact closely to ensure smooth progress and collaboration:

- **Sprint Planning:** The Product Owner presents the prioritized backlog items, and the Development Team selects the ones they can commit to for the sprint. The Scrum Master facilitates the planning session, ensuring clear communication and that the team does not overcommit.

- **Daily Stand-Ups:** Each day, the Development Team members discuss their progress, any roadblocks, and their plans for the next 24 hours. The Scrum Master helps identify and resolve impediments, while the Product Owner may listen in to stay informed but typically does not actively participate.

- **Sprint Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team presents the completed work to stakeholders. The Product Owner validates that the work meets the acceptance criteria, and the Scrum Master facilitates the session, ensuring productive feedback.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** After the Sprint Review, the entire Scrum team, including the Product Owner, participates in the Retrospective. They reflect on the sprint, discuss what went well and what could be improved, and identify actionable improvements for future sprints. The Scrum Master facilitates this session to ensure it is constructive and focused.

These interactions help maintain transparency, foster collaboration, and ensure that the team remains focused on delivering value.


# **Backlog**

### Interviewer:
Can you explain the difference between a product backlog and a sprint backlog in simple terms?

### Candidate:
Sure, I'd be happy to explain this in simple terms.

1. **Product Backlog:**
   - **What It Is:** The product backlog is a prioritized list of everything that needs to be done to improve or complete the product. Think of it as a big to-do list for the entire project.
   - **Contents:** It contains user stories, features, bug fixes, technical tasks, and any other requirements for the product.
   - **Ownership:** This list is typically owned and managed by the Product Owner, who continuously updates it based on changing needs and priorities.

2. **Sprint Backlog:**
   - **What It Is:** The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog. It consists of the items that the team commits to completing during the upcoming Sprint, which is usually a 1-4 week period.
   - **Contents:** It contains specific tasks and user stories pulled from the product backlog, broken down into smaller, actionable chunks that can be completed within the Sprint.
   - **Ownership:** The development team owns the sprint backlog. They select the items from the product backlog during the Sprint Planning meeting and then manage and update it throughout the Sprint.

### Interviewer:
That’s a clear explanation. So in short, the product backlog is the master list of all desired work for the product, while the sprint backlog is the list of work the team commits to complete during a specific Sprint.

### Candidate:
Exactly! The product backlog provides a long-term view of the product’s development, while the sprint backlog focuses on the immediate, actionable work for the current Sprint.





# **Sprint Goals**

**Interviewer:** Thank you for being here today. During the Sprint, does the Sprint Goal cover 100% of all the tasks that are in the Sprint?

**Candidate:** That's a great question. The Sprint Goal serves as a guiding objective for what the team aims to achieve during the Sprint. While it does encapsulate the primary focus and purpose of the Sprint, it doesn't necessarily cover every single task. There are often supplementary tasks and activities that support achieving the goal, such as bug fixes, technical improvements, or preparatory work for future Sprints, which might not be explicitly included in the Sprint Goal but are still essential for the overall workflow. Therefore, while the Sprint Goal defines the main target, it doesn't typically cover 100% of all tasks involved in the Sprint.


# **Plan 2 Week Sprint**

### Interviewer:
Great, thank you for coming in today. Let's dive into a scenario question. Imagine you are leading a team and you have been asked to plan work for a two-week Sprint. You have a backlog of tasks. Can you walk me through what you would do and any best practices you would use for this process?

### Candidate:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to walk you through it.

First and foremost, I would start with a Sprint Planning meeting with the entire team. This meeting allows us to determine what work items from the backlog we can commit to for the upcoming Sprint. Here’s how I would approach it:

1. **Reviewing the Backlog:**
   - **Prioritize:** Ensure that the backlog is prioritized by the Product Owner. The most critical tasks that deliver the highest value should be at the top.
   - **Refinement:** Make sure that all items in the backlog are well-defined, with clear acceptance criteria. Any ambiguous or too-large tasks would need refinement, either before or during the Sprint Planning meeting.

2. **Capacity Planning:**
   - **Assess Team Availability:** Understand the availability of each team member, taking into account any planned time off, meetings, or other commitments.
   - **Velocity:** Look at the team's historical velocity, which is the amount of work successfully completed in previous Sprints, to provide a guideline for how much work can realistically be taken on.

3. **Task Selection:**
   - **Team Involvement:** Engage the team in selecting the tasks they feel comfortable committing to. This promotes a sense of ownership and increases the likelihood of meeting Sprint goals.
   - **Estimating Tasks:** Use a consistent method for estimating task size, such as Story Points, and ensure all tasks are appropriately estimated.

4. **Task Breakdown:**
   - For larger user stories or tasks, break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. This helps keep track of progress without getting overwhelmed by the size of tasks.
   
5. **Creating a Sprint Goal:**
   - Define a clear and concise Sprint Goal that represents the main objective of the Sprint. This helps the team stay focused on what is most important.

6. **Assigning Tasks:**
   - While team members may choose their tasks based on expertise or interest, I’d ensure that task assignments are balanced to avoid overloading any one individual.
   
7. **Monitoring Progress:**
   - Implement daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, identify any blockers, and make any necessary adjustments.
   - Use project management tools (like JIRA, Trello, etc.) to visualize the work and track progress.

8. **Review and Retrospect:**
   - At the end of the Sprint, conduct a Sprint Review to demonstrate what has been completed and gather feedback.
   - Hold a Sprint Retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how we can improve in the next Sprint.

### Interviewer:
That’s a thorough and well-structured approach. How would you handle any unexpected issues that come up during the Sprint?

### Candidate:
Unexpected issues are bound to occur, and being adaptable is key. Here’s how I’d handle them:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - **Identify Blockers:** In daily stand-ups, I’d ensure that any blockers are immediately discussed and assigned for resolution.
   - **Communicate:** I would maintain open lines of communication with the Product Owner and stakeholders about any significant issues that might affect the Sprint Goal.

2. **Prioritize and Adjust:**
   - Re-assess the remaining tasks and their priorities. If necessary, I’d reallocate resources to ensure that the highest priority tasks are still completed.
   - Consider whether scope adjustments are necessary. Sometimes, deprioritizing less critical tasks can be an effective way to manage time and resources.

3. **Support and Resources:**
   - Provide any necessary support to team members, whether that's in the form of additional resources, advice, or help from other team members.

4. **Document and Learn:**
   - Document any issues and responses taken, using them as learning points to prepare for and mitigate similar issues in the future.

This way, we stay flexible and resilient, ensuring that despite unforeseen issues, we can still deliver valuable outcomes.

### Interviewer:
Excellent, it sounds like you have a solid strategy for both planning and dealing with unexpected challenges. Thank you for your thorough answers.
