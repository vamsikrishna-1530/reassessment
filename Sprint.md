# ** Sprint Goals**

**Interviewer:** Thank you for being here today. During the Sprint, does the Sprint Goal cover 100% of all the tasks that are in the Sprint?

**Candidate:** That's a great question. The Sprint Goal serves as a guiding objective for what the team aims to achieve during the Sprint. While it does encapsulate the primary focus and purpose of the Sprint, it doesn't necessarily cover every single task. There are often supplementary tasks and activities that support achieving the goal, such as bug fixes, technical improvements, or preparatory work for future Sprints, which might not be explicitly included in the Sprint Goal but are still essential for the overall workflow. Therefore, while the Sprint Goal defines the main target, it doesn't typically cover 100% of all tasks involved in the Sprint.
