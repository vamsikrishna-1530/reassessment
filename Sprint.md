# **Sprint Roles**

**Candidate:** Absolutely! In a Scrum team, there are three key roles:

1. **Product Owner:** The Product Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product and prioritizing the product backlog. They ensure that the team is working on the most important and valuable tasks. They act as the voice of the customer, balancing stakeholder interests and business goals.

2. **Scrum Master:** The Scrum Master serves as a facilitator and coach for the Scrum team. They help the team adhere to Scrum practices and principles, remove any impediments that may hinder progress, and foster an environment of continuous improvement. The Scrum Master also ensures that the team follows the agreed-upon processes and ceremonies such as sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

3. **Development Team:** The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint. This team is typically cross-functional, including developers, testers, designers, and other specialists as required. Everyone in the Development Team works collaboratively, shares responsibility for the project, and is accountable for delivering the product increment.

# **Sprint Activities**

**Interviewer:** Thatâ€™s a comprehensive explanation! Could you also talk about how these roles interact with each other during a sprint?

**Candidate:** Certainly! During a sprint, the roles interact closely to ensure smooth progress and collaboration:

- **Sprint Planning:** The Product Owner presents the prioritized backlog items, and the Development Team selects the ones they can commit to for the sprint. The Scrum Master facilitates the planning session, ensuring clear communication and that the team does not overcommit.

- **Daily Stand-Ups:** Each day, the Development Team members discuss their progress, any roadblocks, and their plans for the next 24 hours. The Scrum Master helps identify and resolve impediments, while the Product Owner may listen in to stay informed but typically does not actively participate.

- **Sprint Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team presents the completed work to stakeholders. The Product Owner validates that the work meets the acceptance criteria, and the Scrum Master facilitates the session, ensuring productive feedback.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** After the Sprint Review, the entire Scrum team, including the Product Owner, participates in the Retrospective. They reflect on the sprint, discuss what went well and what could be improved, and identify actionable improvements for future sprints. The Scrum Master facilitates this session to ensure it is constructive and focused.

These interactions help maintain transparency, foster collaboration, and ensure that the team remains focused on delivering value.





# **Sprint Goals**

**Interviewer:** Thank you for being here today. During the Sprint, does the Sprint Goal cover 100% of all the tasks that are in the Sprint?

**Candidate:** That's a great question. The Sprint Goal serves as a guiding objective for what the team aims to achieve during the Sprint. While it does encapsulate the primary focus and purpose of the Sprint, it doesn't necessarily cover every single task. There are often supplementary tasks and activities that support achieving the goal, such as bug fixes, technical improvements, or preparatory work for future Sprints, which might not be explicitly included in the Sprint Goal but are still essential for the overall workflow. Therefore, while the Sprint Goal defines the main target, it doesn't typically cover 100% of all tasks involved in the Sprint.
