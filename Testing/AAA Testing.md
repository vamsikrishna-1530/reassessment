# **AAA pattern in unit testing?**

**Candidate:** Sure! The AAA pattern stands for Arrange, Act, and Assert. It is a common pattern used in writing unit tests to make them more readable and maintainable. It breaks down the test into three distinct sections:

1. **Arrange:** This section is where we set up the necessary conditions and inputs for the test. It involves initializing objects, setting up mocks, and preparing any required data.

2. **Act:** In this section, we perform the actual operation that we want to test. This usually involves calling a method or function on the object initialized in the Arrange step.

3. **Assert:** Finally, in the Assert section, we verify that the outcome of the Act step is as expected. This involves checking the return values, the state of objects, or any other side effects.

Hereâ€™s a simple example in C#:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsSum()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new Calculator();
    var number1 = 5;
    var number2 = 10;

    // Act
    var result = calculator.Add(number1, number2);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(15, result);
}
```

In this example:
- The `Arrange` section sets up a `Calculator` object and initializes two numbers.
- The `Act` section performs the addition using the `Add` method.
- The `Assert` section checks that the result is 15, which is the expected sum of 5 and 10.

**Interviewer:** Good explanation! Why is it important to follow the AAA pattern in unit testing?

**Candidate:** Following the AAA pattern in unit testing provides a clear and consistent structure to tests, which makes them easier to read and understand. It helps developers quickly grasp what the test is doing, what conditions are set up, and what is being verified. It also encourages separation of concerns, ensuring that setup, execution, and validation are handled in distinct steps. This can help in maintaining the tests and diagnosing issues when they arise.


# **Mocking and Stubbing in the context of testing?**

**Candidate:**
Certainly! Both mocking and stubbing are test-double techniques used in unit testing to isolate the code being tested and control its dependencies. Here is a simple differentiation between the two:

1. **Stubbing:**
    - **Purpose:** Stubs are used to provide predetermined responses to method calls made during the test.
    - **Behavior:** They don't verify any behavior, but they help in testing the code by returning expected results.
    - **Example:** If you have a function that calls an external API, you can stub the API call to return a fixed response without actually making the network request.

2. **Mocking:**
    - **Purpose:** Mocks are used to verify how many times an interaction happens, the exact methods that were called, and the arguments that were passed.
    - **Behavior:** They not only simulate the behavior but also allow you to set expectations and then verify those expectations.
    - **Example:** If you want to ensure a function is called with certain parameters when testing, you would use a mock to verify that the exact call was made with the expected arguments.

In summary, stubs are focused on providing fixed data whereas mocks are used to test the behavior and interactions within the code.
