# Explanation of the Definition of Done in Scrum

The *Definition of Done* (DoD) is a crucial concept in the Scrum framework. It serves as an agreed-upon set of criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete. This ensures transparency and quality and prevents the accumulation of technical debt. Hereâ€™s how one might explain the Definition of Done during an interview or on a team:

### **Interviewer**: Could you explain what 'Definition of Done' means in Scrum?

### **Answer**:
Certainly! In Scrum, the Definition of Done (DoD) establishes clear and concise criteria for when a task, user story, or backlog item is considered "complete." This definition is essential to maintain consistency in understanding what "done" means across all team members, stakeholders, and potentially across multiple Scrum teams.

### **Key Aspects of the Definition of Done**

#### 1. **Quality Standards**
The DoD includes specific quality standards that need to be met. For example, it might specify that the code must pass all regression tests, performance must meet certain benchmarks, and the feature must be fully documented.

#### 2. **Acceptance Criteria Met**
Each user story comes with acceptance criteria pre-defined by the Product Owner that describes the conditions under which the story is accepted. The completion of these criteria must be a part of the Definition of Done.

#### 3. **Reviewed by Peers**
Often, the DoD requires that the feature or task must be reviewed by peers or other roles within the team, such as QA engineers, to ensure it meets the expected standards and functions correctly.

#### 4. **Integration**
The work should be integrated with the existing system, ensuring compatibility and correct functioning within the whole system. This may include integration testing as a part of the Definition of Done.

#### 5. **Documentation**
Documentation requirements should also be met as per the Definition of Done regulations, which can include both the technical documentation for the code and the end-user documentation for the implemented features.

### **Purpose of the Definition of Done**

- **Transparency**: Everyone on the team and the stakeholders understand explicitly what is expected for the work to be considered complete.
- **Quality Control**: It helps in maintaining a high standard of quality by ensuring that predefined criteria are met before a product increment is shipped.
- **Facilitate Trust**: Stakeholders can trust that complete increments conform to their expectations and are truly ready for potential release or to build upon in subsequent sprints.

### **Setting Up a Definition of Done**

The Definition of Done is usually created during the initial sprints with input from the team, the Product Owner, and other stakeholders. It needs to be prominently displayed and regularly revisited to ensure it remains relevant as the team's needs and the project evolve.

### **Conclusion**

The Definition of Done is a fundamental artifact in Scrum for aligning the team and stakeholders on when a task is complete, upholding product quality, and ensuring a shared understanding of project progress. It's a dynamic agreement that should evolve as the team's dynamics or project scope change.
