### **Question 1:**  
How would you handle a critical issue in production beyond just notifying the team or customer?

**Answer:**  
When a critical issue arises in production, my approach would be:  
1. **Immediate Triage** – Identify the severity and impact of the issue.  
2. **Notify Stakeholders** – Inform the team and relevant stakeholders while maintaining transparency.  
3. **Root Cause Analysis** – Investigate logs, monitor system behavior, and reproduce the issue if possible.  
4. **Actionable Fix** – Implement a short-term fix if necessary (hotfix/rollback) and plan a long-term solution.  
5. **Process Improvement** – Improve the **estimation process**, **QA acceptance criteria**, and **code review practices** to prevent similar issues in the future.  
6. **Post-Mortem & Documentation** – Conduct a retrospective to document lessons learned and update best practices.

### **Question 2:**  
How would you improve the quality of deliverables in a React.js project to minimize production issues?  

**Answer:**  
1. **Refine Acceptance Criteria** – Work with the product team to define clear and testable requirements.  
2. **Enhance QA Process** – Introduce automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), code coverage analysis, and manual exploratory testing.  
3. **Improve Estimation Process** – Ensure accurate sprint planning by considering edge cases and technical debt.  
4. **Static Code Analysis** – Enforce ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript to catch issues early.  
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Improvements** – Set up automated deployments with rollback capabilities and proper staging environments.  
6. **Monitor and Log** – Use tools like Sentry, Datadog, or LogRocket to capture runtime errors proactively.

### **Question 3:**  
Can you describe a time when you had to adapt quickly to a project change, and what steps you took?  

**Answer:**  
In one project, a major requirement change was introduced mid-sprint, affecting our timeline. My approach was:  
1. **Reassessed the Scope** – Analyzed the new requirements and their technical impact.  
2. **Revised Estimations** – Updated story points and sprint commitments with the team.  
3. **Communicated with Stakeholders** – Explained feasibility and suggested trade-offs to the product team.  
4. **Prioritized Critical Changes** – Focused on the most impactful updates while maintaining code quality.  
5. **Updated Test Plans** – Ensured new changes had adequate test coverage.  
6. **Retrospective & Documentation** – Learned from the experience to improve adaptability in future sprints.
