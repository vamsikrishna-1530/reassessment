### **Q1: What steps would you take when a critical issue occurs in a React.js application in production?**  

**Answer:**  
Handling a critical issue requires both immediate action and long-term preventive measures. Here‚Äôs a structured approach:  

1. **Immediate Triage & Notification**  
   - Identify the impact and severity of the issue.  
   - Notify relevant stakeholders (team, QA, product owner, and customer if needed).  
   - Use monitoring/logging tools (e.g., **Sentry, Datadog, LogRocket**) to gather error details.  

2. **Root Cause Analysis**  
   - Reproduce the issue in a controlled environment.  
   - Check for recent code changes or dependencies that may have caused the issue.  
   - Review logs, network requests, and browser console errors.  

3. **Temporary Mitigation (If Needed)**  
   - Apply a quick fix (e.g., **feature flag, rollback, or temporary patch**) to minimize user impact.  
   - Communicate expected resolution time to stakeholders.  

4. **Permanent Fix Implementation**  
   - Develop a proper solution following coding standards.  
   - Write appropriate **unit and integration tests** to prevent regression.  
   - Perform code review and testing before deploying the fix.  

5. **Post-Mortem & Prevention Measures**  
   - Conduct a **retrospective** to analyze the root cause and avoid recurrence.  
   - Improve **QA processes** by adding better acceptance criteria and test coverage.  
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting to catch similar issues earlier.  

**Pros:**  
‚úÖ Reduces downtime and user frustration.  
‚úÖ Ensures structured resolution and prevents recurrence.  
‚úÖ Improves team collaboration and learning.  

**Cons:**  
‚ùå Hotfixes may introduce **technical debt** if not addressed properly later.  
‚ùå Rushed fixes without proper testing can lead to **new issues.**

### **Q2: How can you improve software quality beyond communication?**  

**Answer:**  
Improving software quality requires a **proactive approach** in multiple areas:  

1. **Refining Estimation Process**  
   - Break down features into **smaller, well-defined tasks.**  
   - Consider complexity factors like **performance, accessibility, and edge cases.**  
   - Use **historical data** and team input for better sprint planning.  

2. **Enhancing Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Clearly define **functional and non-functional requirements.**  
   - Ensure test scenarios cover **edge cases and user flows.**  
   - Collaborate with **QA and product teams** to define expectations early.  

3. **Strengthening QA Processes**  
   - Implement the **Test Pyramid:**  
     - ‚úÖ **Unit tests** (Jest, React Testing Library)  
     - ‚úÖ **Integration tests** (React Testing Library, Mock APIs)  
     - ‚úÖ **E2E tests** (Cypress, Playwright)  
   - Automate **CI/CD pipelines** to prevent untested code from being deployed.  
   - Conduct **regular code reviews** to maintain code quality.  

**Pros:**  
‚úÖ Reduces post-release bugs and rework.  
‚úÖ Enhances collaboration between developers, QA, and product teams.  
‚úÖ Improves overall software maintainability.  

**Cons:**  
‚ùå Requires **initial effort** to refine processes.  
‚ùå Test automation may add **overhead in setup and maintenance.**

### **Q3: How do you reduce technical debt in a React.js project?**  

**Answer:**  
Reducing technical debt requires a balance between **feature development and codebase maintainability.**  

1. **Identify & Prioritize Debt**  
   - Conduct **code audits** to identify problematic areas (e.g., legacy code, unused dependencies).  
   - Use **tools like SonarQube, ESLint, and TypeScript** for static analysis.  
   - Maintain a **technical debt backlog** to track and resolve issues incrementally.  

2. **Gradual Refactoring**  
   - Avoid complete rewrites‚Äî**refactor incrementally.**  
   - Modularize large components into **reusable, maintainable pieces.**  
   - Improve **state management** (e.g., replacing unnecessary Redux usage with React Query or Context API).  

3. **Improve Documentation & Code Standards**  
   - Maintain **up-to-date documentation** for better onboarding and collaboration.  
   - Follow React best practices like **functional components and hooks** to simplify logic.  

4. **Strengthen Testing & Automation**  
   - Increase **unit and integration test coverage** to prevent regressions.  
   - Automate **linting and formatting** using Prettier and ESLint to enforce code consistency.  

**Pros:**  
‚úÖ Makes the codebase easier to **extend and maintain.**  
‚úÖ Reduces unexpected bugs and **improves developer productivity.**  

**Cons:**  
‚ùå Refactoring without business justification may delay **feature development.**  
‚ùå Requires continuous effort and buy-in from **stakeholders.**

### **Q4: Explain the Test Pyramid and its relevance to React.js projects.**  

**Answer:**  
The **Test Pyramid** helps ensure a balanced and efficient testing strategy:  

1. **Unit Tests (Base - Majority of Tests)**  
   - Test individual functions/components.  
   - **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library.  

2. **Integration Tests (Middle Layer - Moderate Tests)**  
   - Validate component interactions, API calls, and data flow.  
   - **Tools:** React Testing Library, Mock Service Worker (MSW).  

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top - Fewest Tests)**  
   - Simulate real user workflows (e.g., login, checkout).  
   - **Tools:** Cypress, Playwright.  

**Pros:**  
‚úÖ Provides high confidence in software stability.  
‚úÖ Prevents regressions without excessive manual testing.  

**Cons:**  
‚ùå E2E tests can be **slow and brittle.**  
‚ùå Writing and maintaining tests requires **continuous effort.**

### **Q5: What are the F.I.R.S.T principles of unit testing, and how do they apply in React.js?**  

**Answer:**  
The **F.I.R.S.T. principles** help write **effective unit tests**:  

1. **Fast:** Tests should execute quickly to allow frequent runs.  
2. **Independent:** Each test should run in isolation without dependencies on others.  
3. **Repeatable:** Tests should produce consistent results across different environments.  
4. **Self-validating:** Each test should have a clear pass/fail outcome.  
5. **Timely:** Tests should be written **early in the development cycle** to prevent defects.  

**Application in React.js:**  
- Use **Jest** for fast, isolated tests.  
- Use **React Testing Library** to test UI behavior without relying on implementation details.  
- Mock API calls to **ensure repeatability.**  

**Pros:**  
‚úÖ Increases confidence in code changes.  
‚úÖ Reduces the risk of introducing bugs during refactoring.  

**Cons:**  
‚ùå Writing proper tests requires **discipline and best practices.**  
‚ùå Poorly written tests can become a **maintenance burden.**
