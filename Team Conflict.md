**Interviewer:** In a situation where two colleagues are disputing over a merge request, and neither is calming down, how would you handle this as a JavaScript Frontend Developer?

**Candidate:**
1. **Stay Neutral:** I would approach the situation with neutrality, ensuring I don't take sides.
2. **Understand the Issues:** I'd try to understand both perspectives by asking each colleague to explain their concerns about the merge request.
3. **Facilitate Communication:**
   - Let each person speak without interruptions.
   - Encourage respectful dialogue and listening.
4. **Find Common Ground:** I'd identify any points of agreement or shared goals to help bridge their differences.
5. **Focus on Facts:** Emphasize facts over opinions, reviewing the code changes and their impact objectively.
6. **Offer Solutions:**
   - Propose potential compromises or solutions that address both colleagues' concerns.
   - Suggest further testing or code reviews if needed.
7. **Involve a Mediator:** If the dispute remains unresolved, Iâ€™d suggest involving a team lead or a manager for a final decision.
8. **Document the Resolution:** Ensure the final decision is documented clearly to avoid future misunderstandings.

This approach helps maintain a professional environment and ensures the decision is made based on merit rather than personal conflict.
