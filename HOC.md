**Interviewer:** Can you explain what a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is in React?

**Candidate:** Sure, I'd be happy to explain. A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, but they are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

**Interviewer:** Can you give a simple definition of how HOCs work?

**Candidate:** Of course. A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. This allows you to add additional functionality to the component that is passed in, without modifying the original component directly.

**Interviewer:** Could you outline some common use cases for HOCs?

**Candidate:** Certainly. Some common use cases for HOCs include:
- Reusability: Sharing common functionality between multiple components.
- Code organization: Separating concerns to make the codebase more maintainable and readable.
- Handling cross-cutting concerns: Such as authentication, logging, and analytics.

**Interviewer:** Can you provide a basic example of an HOC in code?

**Candidate:** Definitely. Here's a simple example of an HOC that adds a loading spinner to a component.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

// This is the HOC
function withLoadingSpinner(WrappedComponent) {
  return function WithLoadingSpinnerComponent({ isLoading, ...props }) {
    if (isLoading) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}

// This is a regular component
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>My Component Content</div>;
}

// This is the component enhanced by the HOC
const MyComponentWithLoadingSpinner = withLoadingSpinner(MyComponent);

// Usage example
<MyComponentWithLoadingSpinner isLoading={true} />
```

In this example, the `withLoadingSpinner` HOC adds a loading spinner to any component when `isLoading` is `true`.

**Interviewer:** That’s a clear explanation. How do you handle props in HOCs?

**Candidate:** Good question. When you create an HOC, it generally needs to pass down any props it receives to the wrapped component. This is typically done using the spread operator (`...props`), like in the example I provided. This ensures that the wrapped component receives all the props it needs to function correctly.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. What are some potential drawbacks of using HOCs?

**Candidate:** There are a few drawbacks to consider:
- Wrapper hell: If you nest too many HOCs, it can become difficult to manage and debug.
- Ref forwarding: HOCs do not automatically forward refs, which can be a limitation if you need to directly access the instance of a wrapped component.
- Prop drilling: It can lead to passing redundant props around, which might clutter the component structure.

**Interviewer:** Great, thank you for the thorough explanation.
