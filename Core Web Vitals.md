### **Google Web Vitals**
Google Web Vitals is a set of metrics introduced by Google to measure and improve the user experience of websites. These metrics focus on key aspects of web performance, particularly loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.

### **Core Web Vitals (Key Metrics)**
Google prioritizes **three main Core Web Vitals**:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Measures loading performance.  
   - **What it does:** Calculates how long it takes for the largest visible element (e.g., an image, video, or text block) to load.  
   - **Good Score:** **â‰¤ 2.5s**  

2. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Measures interactivity.  
   - **What it does:** Tracks the time from when a user first interacts (clicks, taps, etc.) to when the browser responds.  
   - **Good Score:** **â‰¤ 100ms**  
   - **(In 2024, Google is replacing FID with Interaction to Next Paint (INP), which better measures overall interactivity.)**

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Measures visual stability.  
   - **What it does:** Evaluates how much content shifts unexpectedly during loading.  
   - **Good Score:** **â‰¤ 0.1**

### **Other Important Web Vitals**
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Measures server response time.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Measures when the first visible content appears.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** Replaces FID in 2024 for better interactivity measurement.

### **How to Measure Web Vitals?**
You can measure Web Vitals using:
1. **Google PageSpeed Insights** - [https://pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev)
2. **Google Search Console** (Core Web Vitals report)
3. **Chrome DevTools** (`Performance` tab)
4. **Lighthouse** (built into Chrome)
5. **Web Vitals JavaScript Library** - [https://web.dev/vitals/](https://web.dev/vitals/)

### **Improving Web Vitals**
- **LCP Optimization:** Optimize images, use a CDN, lazy-load non-essential assets.
- **FID/INP Optimization:** Minimize JavaScript execution time, remove unnecessary third-party scripts.
- **CLS Optimization:** Use fixed dimensions for images and ads, avoid inserting elements dynamically.
