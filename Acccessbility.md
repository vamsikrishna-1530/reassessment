Great question — here's how you can **professionally answer** the question **“How do you handle accessibility (a11y) issues in a Next.js project?”** in an interview as a frontend engineer:

### ✅ **Q: How do you handle a11y (accessibility) issues in a Next.js project?**

**A:**  
Accessibility is a key part of delivering inclusive user experiences, and I approach it in multiple ways across development, testing, and review stages.

---

### 🧰 **1. Development Best Practices**

- I follow **semantic HTML** — using the correct tags (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, etc.) to provide inherent accessibility.
- Use **ARIA attributes** (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) to support assistive technologies when semantics alone aren’t enough.
- Ensure **keyboard accessibility**:
  - All interactive elements are focusable (`tabindex`)
  - Custom components respond to `Enter` and `Space`
- Provide **alt text** for images, and use `role` where appropriate.
- Use **focus management** in modals, dropdowns, and page transitions with tools like `focus-trap-react` or manually with `ref`.

---

### 🔍 **2. Use Accessibility Tools & Linters**

- In Next.js, I integrate **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** into the ESLint config to catch issues during development.
```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --save-dev
```

- I also use **storybook’s a11y addon** (if the project has component previews).
- Run **Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools) or **axe-core** browser extension for automated audits.

---

### 🧪 **3. Manual & Screen Reader Testing**

- I test with **keyboard-only navigation** to ensure proper focus order and skip links.
- Use **NVDA (Windows)** or **VoiceOver (Mac)** for screen reader testing.
- I also simulate reduced motion or color blindness using Chrome DevTools accessibility settings.

---

### ⚙️ **4. Fixing Reported a11y Bugs**

- I check the reported issue in the DOM to understand the root (e.g., missing labels, poor contrast, bad roles).
- Use devtools like **axe DevTools** to locate failing elements.
- Fix issues by either:
  - Updating semantic HTML
  - Adding missing ARIA attributes
  - Correcting role misuse
  - Improving color contrast or focus styles using Tailwind’s `focus:outline` and `ring` utilities.

---

### 🌐 **5. Next.js Specific Techniques**

- Ensure pages use the built-in `<Head>` component to include descriptive `<title>` and `<meta>` tags.
- For routing and navigation with `next/link`, ensure that custom elements (like divs styled as links) are focusable and behave like native links.
- I add `aria-live` or `role="status"` regions for screen reader announcements after navigation or form submission success.

---

### 🎯 Final Note:

Accessibility is **not a one-time fix**, it's an ongoing practice. I treat it like performance or security — something we build into the workflow from design to deployment.
