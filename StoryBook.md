Absolutely! Here's a **theoretical, interview-style answer** to:

**"How do you create components in Storybook, deploy them to artifacts, and integrate them into a project that requires a license or JWT token?"**

---

**Answer (as a candidate):**

To manage UI components effectively and in isolation, I use **Storybook** as a development and documentation tool. Here‚Äôs how I handle it across creation, deployment, and integration with secure systems:

---

### 1. **Creating Components in Storybook**

First, I create reusable UI components in a modular structure‚Äîeach component has its own folder with the implementation and a `.stories.tsx` file.

Storybook supports the **Component Story Format (CSF)**, where I define a default export describing the component and named exports for different states or variations. This allows designers, developers, and testers to explore components independently of the app.

This is especially useful in teams following design systems or atomic design principles, as it promotes reusability and consistency.

### 2. **Deploying to Artifacts**

Once components are created, I run `npm run build-storybook` to generate a static version of the Storybook site.

In a CI/CD pipeline (like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps), I:
- Build the Storybook output as part of the pipeline.
- Publish it either:
  - As a **pipeline artifact**, for internal use or download.
  - Or, deploy it to a **static hosting service** like Netlify, Vercel, or an S3 bucket for easy sharing.

This enables teams to access a centralized UI library and ensures components are version-controlled and tied to build pipelines.

### 3. **Integration in a Project Requiring License or JWT**

When integrating Storybook components into a project that requires **authentication or license validation**, I consider two scenarios:

#### ‚úÖ If the goal is to test UI **in isolation**:
- I **mock the authentication logic**, license check, or API calls using tools like **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**.
- I can also wrap components in a custom provider using **Storybook decorators** to simulate a logged-in state or inject a fake token.

#### üîê If real integration is needed (e.g., end-to-end previews):
- I configure **environment variables** in the CI/CD pipeline to provide a valid JWT or license key at runtime.
- This way, Storybook can interact with secured APIs during preview builds, while keeping secrets safe.

---

**Summary:**

In theory, Storybook helps me develop components in isolation, I deploy it as part of CI/CD pipelines as artifacts or previews, and for secure projects, I either mock authentication or securely inject tokens‚Äîdepending on the need for realism versus isolation.
