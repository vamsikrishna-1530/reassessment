Absolutely! Here's how to confidently answer the **"Explain routing in Next.js and different approaches"** question in an interview — from a candidate's perspective:

---

**🧑‍💼 Interviewer:**  
*Can you explain how routing works in Next.js and the different types of routing approaches available?*

---

**✅ Your Answer (Candidate-style):**

> Yes, absolutely!
>
> One of the things I love about Next.js is that it provides a **file-based routing system**, which makes creating routes really intuitive. Depending on the project setup — **Pages Router** or **App Router** — the routing style differs slightly. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 📁 1. **Pages Router (Legacy, pre-Next.js 13)**

> - Each file in the `pages/` directory automatically becomes a route.
> - For example, `pages/about.tsx` maps to `/about`.
> - Dynamic routes are created using square brackets, like `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`.
> - I used this in earlier projects before Next.js 13, and it’s still great for simple apps or migrations.

---

### 🧩 2. **App Router (New in Next.js 13+)**

> - Introduces a **React Server Components-first architecture**.
> - Routing is defined through folders inside the `app/` directory.
> - Every folder can have a `page.tsx` (route), `layout.tsx` (shared UI), and optional `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, etc.
>
> 🔄 *Example:* In my current insurance project, I use:
> ```
> app/
> ├─ layout.tsx       ← shared layout
> ├─ page.tsx         ← homepage
> ├─ form/
> │   ├─ page.tsx     ← /form route
> │   ├─ success/
> │   │   └─ page.tsx ← /form/success route
> ```

---

### 🔀 3. **Dynamic Routing**

> - Both `pages/` and `app/` support dynamic routes:
>   - `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` → `/blog/hello-world`
>   - `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → same
> - I’ve used this to build content-driven pages like policy summaries, where the slug or ID changes based on user selection.

---

### 🔁 4. **Catch-All & Optional Catch-All**

> - `[...params].tsx` → captures `/a/b/c`
> - `[[...params]].tsx` → same but also allows no param
>
> I used this to build a **404 fallback** and also a flexible landing page system for marketing.

---

### 🔗 5. **Linking Between Routes**

> - In both routing styles, we use `<Link>` from `next/link` for client-side navigation, which improves performance with prefetching.
> - I make sure to use `<Link>` with `prefetch={false}` in cases where I want to avoid unnecessary network usage.

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Route Groups & Parallel Routes (App Router)

> - Route groups (`(groupName)`) help organize files without affecting the URL.
> - Parallel routes let us render different sections of a page simultaneously.
> - I used route groups in the insurance app to separate authenticated vs. public pages cleanly.

---

> Overall, I prefer using the **App Router for new projects** because it supports layouts, server/client component separation, and better loading strategies out of the box. But I’ve worked with both and understand how to make the best choice based on project needs.
