 # *Can you explain the difference between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` in Next.js?*

> Absolutely!
>
> Both `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are data-fetching methods in the **Pages Router** of Next.js, and they help decide **when** and **how** data is fetched for a page.

---

### 🧊 `getStaticProps` – **Static Site Generation (SSG)**

> - Runs **at build time** — the HTML is pre-rendered once during deployment.
> - Fast and great for **performance and SEO**, since it serves static files.
> - Best used for content that **doesn’t change often** — like blogs, FAQs, documentation.
>
> 💡 *In my project:*  
> I used `getStaticProps` for the **FAQ and terms pages** in the insurance form flow — they didn’t need real-time data and benefited from fast load times.

---

### 🔄 `getServerSideProps` – **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

> - Runs **on every request** — the server generates fresh HTML each time.
> - Useful for pages with **dynamic, real-time data** or when user context (like auth) is needed.
> - Slightly slower than static, but ensures **up-to-date content**.
>
> 💡 *In my project:*  
> I used `getServerSideProps` on the **plan comparison page** where we needed up-to-date pricing and filtering based on user selections or query parameters.

### 🧠 Summary Table:

| Feature             | `getStaticProps`             | `getServerSideProps`         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Render Time         | At build time                | At request time              |
| Use Case            | Static content               | Dynamic, real-time content   |
| Performance         | Very fast                    | Slightly slower (per request)|
| SEO Friendly        | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                        |
| Runs On             | Build server                 | Node.js server (each request)|
| Can use context?    | ❌ No (no request object)     | ✅ Yes (gets `req`, `res`)    |

> So, in short:  
> 👉 I use `getStaticProps` when performance and speed matter most, and the data is relatively static.  
> 👉 I use `getServerSideProps` when I need fresh data per user or per request.

Great follow-up! Yes — in **Next.js (Pages Router)**, apart from `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`, we have a few more data fetching methods and props. Here's a complete **interview-style answer** if they ask:

---

### 🧵 Summary of all data-fetching methods (Pages Router):

| Method              | When it runs       | Use Case                          |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `getStaticProps`    | At build time      | Static content                    |
| `getServerSideProps`| On each request    | Dynamic, user-specific content    |
| `getStaticPaths`    | At build time      | For dynamic SSG routes            |
| `getInitialProps`   | On server + client | Legacy, not recommended           |

---

### 🚀 Bonus: App Router (New)

> If we use the **App Router**, things are different:
> - No more `getStaticProps`, etc.
> - Instead, we **fetch data directly** inside Server or Client Components using:
>   - `fetch()`, `getData()`, or third-party libraries like SWR or React Query
>   - It supports **server components by default** and handles caching automatically.
>
> In my current work with the App Router, I use **async server components** and fetch inside layouts or pages using native `fetch()` — it's cleaner and scales better.

---

> So yes, apart from `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticPaths` is very useful for dynamic SSG, and `getInitialProps` exists but is generally avoided in modern Next.js apps.
