Absolutely! Here’s a concise and confident way to answer **"How do you handle complex Redux state management in a Next.js app?"** using only `react-redux` — tailored for an interview setting:

**Answer (as a candidate):**

In a Next.js application, I handle complex Redux state using `react-redux` by organizing state into **feature-based slices**, applying **middleware** like `redux-thunk` for async logic, and ensuring proper **hydration** between server and client.

1. **Store Setup:**
   I define the Redux store in a central file (e.g., `store.ts`) with `combineReducers` to keep state modular. For Next.js, I use a custom `_app.tsx` to wrap the app with the Redux `<Provider>`.

2. **Server-Side Support:**
   Since Next.js supports SSR, I ensure proper state hydration by preloading data in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` and dispatching necessary actions if needed, then passing that data via props.

3. **Modular Structure:**
   For complexity, I separate logic into:
   - **Slice reducers** for each domain (e.g., auth, cart, user)
   - **Selectors** to abstract state access
   - **Thunk actions** for async flows like API calls

4. **Avoiding Prop Drilling:**
   Redux helps me manage deeply nested or shared state (e.g., auth state, shopping cart) without excessive prop drilling.

5. **Debugging and DevTools:**
   I enable Redux DevTools in dev mode to monitor and debug state changes clearly.

6. **Performance:**
   To avoid unnecessary re-renders, I use `useSelector` carefully and memoize components where needed.
