# Functional vs Non-Functional in Web Development

Functional and non-functional requirements play significant roles in defining the intended behavior and performance of a web application. Understanding the differences between the two categories helps developers design and build high-quality web applications.

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the features and capabilities that a web application must have to serve its intended purpose. These requirements specify the expected behavior, such as what the application should do when users interact with it.

### Examples of Functional Requirements

- User registration and authentication
- Data input validation and error handling
- Search functionality with filtering and sorting
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are concerned with the characteristics of a web application that influence its performance, usability, security, and other aspects unrelated to its core features. These requirements typically cover qualities that enhance the end-user experience or ensure the application's long-term viability.

### Examples of Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Load times, response times, and resource usage
- Scalability: Ability to handle growth in the number of users or increased operations
- Usability: User-friendliness, intuitiveness, and accessibility
- Security: Protection of user data, confidentiality, and secure communication
- Maintainability: Ease of updating, testing, and fixing issues in the codebase

In web development, being mindful of functional and non-functional requirements helps guide decision-making during the design and implementation phases. Striving for a balance between the two leads to applications that not only meet their intended objectives but also offer a positive user experience and stand the test of time.
