# Interviewer: **Can you explain whether Angular follows the MVC pattern?**

### Candidate:
Sure, Angular does not strictly follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern in a traditional sense. Instead, Angular follows a component-based architecture. 

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular breaks the user interface into smaller, reusable components rather than following the traditional MVC pattern.

- **Services and Dependency Injection**: Angular uses services to manage business logic and data communication, which can be injected into components as needed.

- **Modules**: Angular applications are organized into modules, which help in structuring the application at a higher level.

While it incorporates elements similar to the MVC pattern such as separation of concerns, Angular's approach is more flexible and modern by focusing on components and services.


# Interviewer: **which design patterns are widely used in Angular?**

### Candidate:
Sure, there are several design patterns commonly used in Angular development:

1. **Component-based Architecture:**
   Angular applications are built using a component-based approach, where each UI element and its corresponding logic are encapsulated within a component. This promotes reusability and maintainability.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
   Angular has built-in support for dependency injection, which allows developers to manage dependencies efficiently. Services can be injected into components, directives, and other services to share functionality.

3. **Observable Pattern:**
   Angular leverages RxJS and Observables for handling asynchronous operations and event streams, making it easy to manage and subscribe to data changes over time.

4. **Singleton Pattern:**
   Services in Angular typically follow the singleton pattern by default, where a single instance of the service is shared across the application, ensuring consistent state and behavior.

5. **Facade Pattern:**
   The facade pattern is used to simplify complex interactions between multiple services or components. It provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the subsystem.

6. **State Management:**
   Patterns like Redux or NgRx are used for state management in Angular applications, providing a predictable state management system based on unidirectional data flow.

7. **Template Pattern:**
   Angular's templates allow developers to define the view layout and bind data dynamically using expressions, directives, and components.

Each of these design patterns helps in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient Angular applications.
