**Interviewer:** Welcome to the interview. I'd like to ask about a fundamental concept in web development. Can you explain the difference between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and outline the differences between the two in simple points? 

**Candidate:** Certainly!

**Client-Side Rendering (CSR):**
1. **Definition:** CSR refers to the process where the client’s browser renders the web page by executing JavaScript.
2. **Workflow:** The server sends a bare-bones HTML document to the client, which includes JavaScript files. The browser then downloads, processes, and executes these files to generate and display the web content.
3. **Load Time:** Initial load can be slower as the browser needs to download and execute the JavaScript.
4. **User Experience:** After the initial load, subsequent interactions (like navigation between pages) tend to be faster because the browser does not need to reload the entire page.
5. **SEO:** Generally less SEO-friendly, as search engines may have difficulty crawling and indexing JavaScript-heavy pages.
6. **Examples:** React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js are commonly used for CSR.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
1. **Definition:** SSR refers to the process where the server renders the web page and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client.
2. **Workflow:** The server processes all the data, compiles the HTML, and sends it to the client. The browser simply displays the received HTML.
3. **Load Time:** Initial load is often faster since the HTML content is available immediately.
4. **User Experience:** May experience slower subsequent interactions, as navigating between pages typically requires the server to re-render and resend the HTML each time.
5. **SEO:** More SEO-friendly, as search engines can easily crawl and index the pre-rendered HTML content.
6. **Examples:** Traditional server-side frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and Next.js (for React).

**Differences between CSR and SSR:**
1. **Initial Load Time:**
   - CSR: Slower initial load.
   - SSR: Faster initial load.

2. **Subsequent Navigation:**
   - CSR: Faster subsequent navigation.
   - SSR: Slower subsequent navigation.

3. **SEO:**
   - CSR: Less SEO-friendly.
   - SSR: More SEO-friendly.

4. **Server Load:**
   - CSR: Less server load as rendering is done on the client’s side.
   - SSR: More server load due to rendering on the server side.

5. **Complexity:**
   - CSR: May require more client-side coding and handling.
   - SSR: Requires server-side rendering logic and infrastructure.

**Candidate:** Does this explanation cover what you wanted to hear, or is there any specific part you would like me to elaborate on?

**Interviewer:** That was a comprehensive explanation. Thank you!
