### **1. Improving Code Quality**  
#### **Q1: What are some important ways to improve code quality in a React.js/JavaScript project?**  
**A:** Some key ways to improve code quality include:  
- **Code Standards**: Following ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code consistency and readability.  
- **Testing**: Implementing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.  
- **Code Reviews**: Regular peer reviews help catch errors early and enforce best practices.  
- **Refactoring**: Keeping the codebase clean by removing redundant code and improving structure.  
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and API documentation make code easier to maintain.

### **2. Understanding Technical Debt**  
#### **Q2: What is technical debt, and how can you manage it in a project?**  
**A:** Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional work due to shortcuts taken in development, such as poor design, lack of tests, or quick fixes.  

**Ways to manage technical debt:**  
- **Regular Refactoring**: Continuously improving existing code without altering functionality.  
- **Code Reviews**: Catching and addressing poor code practices early.  
- **Automated Tests**: Ensuring that changes do not introduce new issues.  
- **Tech Debt Backlog**: Keeping track of and prioritizing technical debt tasks.  
- **Following Best Practices**: Adhering to SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

### **3. Test Pyramid & Best Practices**  
#### **Q3: What is the Test Pyramid, and why is it important?**  
**A:** The Test Pyramid is a model that illustrates the ideal balance of different types of software tests:  
- **Unit Tests (Base)**: Small, fast tests that check individual functions or components.  
- **Integration Tests (Middle)**: Ensure different modules interact correctly.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top)**: Test the entire application workflow from the user's perspective.  

This approach ensures fast feedback, reliability, and maintainability.  

#### **Q4: What are the F.I.R.S.T principles for unit testing?**  
**A:** The **F.I.R.S.T** principles ensure effective unit tests:  
- **Fast**: Tests should execute quickly to provide rapid feedback.  
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other.  
- **Repeatable**: Tests should produce the same results regardless of the environment.  
- **Self-Validating**: Tests should have clear pass/fail results.  
- **Timely**: Tests should be written alongside or before the implementation (TDD - Test-Driven Development).
