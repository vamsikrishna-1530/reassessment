## **Software Engineering Practices ‚Äì Q&A**

### **1. Code Quality Improvements**
#### **Q1: What are some ways to improve code quality?**  
**A:** Code quality can be improved through the following approaches:  
1. **Code Standards:** Following style guides (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript style guide) ensures consistency.  
2. **Linting and Formatting:** Tools like ESLint and Prettier enforce best practices and code style.  
3. **Code Reviews:** Peer reviews help catch bugs and improve maintainability.  
4. **Testing:** Writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests improves reliability.  
5. **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like SonarQube detect vulnerabilities and code smells.  
6. **Refactoring:** Regularly improving code structure without changing functionality.  

#### **Pros & Cons**  
‚úÖ Ensures maintainability, scalability, and fewer defects.  
‚ùå Takes additional time and may slow down development in the short term.

### **2. Understanding Technical Debt**
#### **Q2: What is technical debt, and why is it important to manage?**  
**A:** Technical debt refers to shortcuts or poor design choices that make future development harder. It arises due to rushed development, lack of refactoring, or ignoring best practices.  

**How to handle technical debt?**  
1. **Identify Debt:** Use tools like SonarQube to detect code smells.  
2. **Prioritize:** Classify debt into high, medium, and low impact.  
3. **Refactor Gradually:** Allocate time in sprints to reduce technical debt.  
4. **Improve Documentation:** Clear documentation prevents knowledge loss.  

#### **Pros & Cons**  
‚úÖ Improves system stability, performance, and maintainability.  
‚ùå Requires additional effort and resources to fix existing debt.

### **3. Understanding the Test Pyramid**
#### **Q3: What is the Test Pyramid, and why is it important?**  
**A:** The Test Pyramid represents the ideal balance of automated tests in a software system.  
- **Unit Tests (Base Layer):** Test small, isolated functions (Jest, Mocha).  
- **Integration Tests (Middle Layer):** Test interaction between modules (React Testing Library).  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top Layer):** Test the full system (Cypress, Playwright).  

#### **Pros & Cons**  
‚úÖ Ensures comprehensive testing coverage while maintaining efficiency.  
‚ùå E2E tests can be slow and flaky if not managed properly.  

---

### **4. Best Practices for Unit Testing (F.I.R.S.T Principles)**
#### **Q4: What are the F.I.R.S.T principles in unit testing?**  
**A:**  
1. **Fast** ‚Äì Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent execution.  
2. **Isolated** ‚Äì Each test should be independent of others.  
3. **Repeatable** ‚Äì Tests should produce the same results regardless of the environment.  
4. **Self-validating** ‚Äì Tests should clearly pass or fail without manual intervention.  
5. **Timely** ‚Äì Write tests during development, not after.  

#### **Pros & Cons**  
‚úÖ Ensures test reliability and effectiveness.  
‚ùå Requires developers to write and maintain tests, adding some overhead.
