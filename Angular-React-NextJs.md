| Feature | **Angular** | **React** | **Next.js** |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Type** | Full-fledged **framework** | UI **library** | React-based **framework** |
| **Language** | TypeScript (built-in) | JavaScript/TypeScript (optional) | JavaScript/TypeScript (optional) |
| **Architecture** | MVC (Model-View-Controller) | Component-based | Component-based (with file-based routing) |

| **Routing** | Built-in router (Angular Router) | React Router (third-party) | Built-in file-based routing |
| **Performance** | Heavy due to complexity but optimized | Lightweight but CSR can slow SEO | Highly optimized with SSR, SSG, and ISR |
| **SEO Friendliness** | Poor (CSR by default) | Poor (CSR by default) | **Excellent** (SSR & SSG support) |
| **Learning Curve** | **Steep** (due to TypeScript & complex concepts) | Moderate (JSX, hooks, state management) | Easier (if familiar with React) |
| **Use Case** | Large enterprise applications | Web apps, SPAs, lightweight projects | SEO-heavy apps, blogs, eCommerce, large-scale projects |
| **Popularity** | Used by enterprises (Google, Microsoft) | Most popular for UI development | Growing rapidly, used by Vercel, GitHub |
