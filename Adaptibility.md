# **1. How do you handle critical issues in a React.js project?**  

#### **Bad Answer:**  
"I would analyze the issue, inform the team and stakeholders, and work on fixing it as soon as possible."

#### **Good Answer:**  
"When a critical issue occurs in a React.js project, I follow a structured approach:  

1. **Immediate Containment & Analysis:**  
   - Identify the severity and impact of the issue.  
   - Check logs, monitoring tools, or error boundaries in React to understand the root cause.  

2. **Short-Term Fix (Hotfix/Workaround):**  
   - If it's affecting production, roll back the last known stable version.  
   - Apply a temporary patch while working on a permanent fix.  

3. **Mid to Long-Term Solutions:**  
   - **Review the Estimation Process:** If the issue stems from unrealistic deadlines, ensure future tasks include proper buffer time.  
   - **Improve Acceptance Criteria:** Clearly define expected behaviors and edge cases before development starts.  
   - **Enhance QA Process:** Introduce automated tests, integration tests, and exploratory testing to catch potential regressions early.  
   - **Monitor & Observe:** Use tools like Sentry, LogRocket, or New Relic to proactively detect issues before users report them.  

4. **Post-Mortem & Prevention:**  
   - Conduct a retrospective to analyze what went wrong.  
   - Implement linting rules, stricter TypeScript checks, or dependency audits to prevent similar issues.  

By taking a structured approach, we not only resolve the immediate issue but also prevent similar problems in the future."

# **2. What steps would you take to improve the quality of a React.js project and avoid critical issues?**  

#### **Good Answer:**  
"To improve the quality of a React.js project and avoid critical issues, I would implement the following practices:  

1. **Code Quality & Reviews:**  
   - Enforce coding standards using ESLint and Prettier.  
   - Conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on performance and maintainability.  

2. **Testing Strategy:**  
   - Follow the **Test Pyramid**:  
     - **Unit tests** for components and utility functions.  
     - **Integration tests** to ensure different parts of the app work together.  
     - **End-to-end tests** using tools like Cypress or Playwright.  
   - Apply **F.I.R.S.T** principles for unit tests (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely).  

3. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Use **React.memo**, **useCallback**, and **useMemo** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
   - Optimize **bundling and code-splitting** using React.lazy and Suspense.  
   - Implement **server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)** where applicable.  

4. **Monitoring & Observability:**  
   - Integrate logging tools (Sentry, Datadog, New Relic) for real-time issue tracking.  
   - Set up user session recording tools like LogRocket to replay bugs.  

5. **Process Improvements:**  
   - Define clear **acceptance criteria** to ensure developers understand feature expectations.  
   - Improve **estimation accuracy** by breaking down features into smaller tasks with realistic deadlines.  
   - Conduct **retrospectives** regularly to learn from past mistakes and improve processes.  

By combining these best practices, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of critical issues in a React.js project."
