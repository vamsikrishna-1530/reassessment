Sure! Here’s a concise version with 10 bullet points:

1. **Prioritize MRs:** Categorize MRs by priority (high, medium, low) to address critical changes first.
2. **Standard Review Checklist:** Follow a consistent checklist covering coding standards, testing, readability, security, and documentation.
3. **Timebox Reviews:** Allocate 15-20 minutes per MR to ensure efficient and focused reviews.
4. **Focus on Critical Areas:** Prioritize functionality, security, and performance during the review process.
5. **Provide Actionable Feedback:** Offer clear, actionable suggestions and highlight what was done well.
6. **Utilize Automation Tools:** Integrate CI/CD tools (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint) to catch syntax and test failures early.
7. **Fast Follow-Up:** Expect developers to address feedback quickly to prevent delays.
8. **Collaborative Ownership:** Encourage peer reviews for additional perspectives and faster feedback.
9. **Encourage Continuous Improvement:** Share recurring issues as learning opportunities and conduct code review retrospectives.
10. **Maintain Objectivity in Disagreements:** Resolve disagreements by focusing on best practices, long-term maintainability, and team goals.

This process ensures smooth and efficient code reviews without compromising code quality.

As an interview candidate, here's how I approach code reviews personally:

1. **Understand the Context:** I start by understanding the purpose of the merge request (MR) or pull request (PR) – what problem is it solving? I look at the relevant Jira or task tickets for context to make sure I’m aligned with the team’s objectives.

2. **Check for Completeness:** I verify if the MR is complete by ensuring that it has the necessary documentation, tests (unit, integration, or E2E), and if any new functionality is properly explained. If something seems missing, I request the necessary updates.

3. **Review Code Quality:** I focus on clean, readable, and maintainable code. This includes:
   - Consistent use of naming conventions.
   - Clear function/method names and component structures.
   - Proper indentation and formatting.
   - Avoiding code repetition (DRY principle).

4. **Check for Performance:** I pay attention to any potential performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms, especially when handling large data sets or optimizing front-end components.

5. **Ensure Proper Testing:** I ensure there are adequate test cases to cover the new code, and the tests are well-structured. I run the tests locally to confirm that they pass.

6. **Review for Security Concerns:** I check for potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, improper handling of sensitive data, and API authentication.

7. **Verify Design and Architecture:** I look at the architecture to ensure it aligns with our team's principles, like modularity, SOLID principles, and scalable design patterns.

8. **Use Linting/Static Analysis:** I rely on automated tools (like ESLint, Prettier, and SonarQube) to catch any syntactical or stylistic issues early. If they catch any errors, I address them.

9. **Comment with Clear, Actionable Feedback:** When leaving comments, I try to be constructive. I highlight good parts of the code and provide suggestions for improvement. If I disagree with an approach, I try to explain why and suggest alternatives.

10. **Balance Between Detail and Speed:** I strike a balance between thoroughness and timeliness. If it's a small change, I may review it quickly, but for large changes, I take more time. I aim for detailed reviews without overloading the team with unnecessary comments.

Ultimately, I aim for my code reviews to foster a culture of learning and improvement while ensuring the quality and performance of the product remain high.
