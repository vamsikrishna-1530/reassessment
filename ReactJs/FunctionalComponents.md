**Interviewer:** Can you explain what functional components are in ReactJS?

**Candidate:** Sure! Functional components in ReactJS are a simpler way to write components that are easier to read and test. They are basically JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements. Unlike class components, functional components do not have their own state or lifecycle methods, but with the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now manage state and side effects.

**Interviewer:** That's a good start. Can you list some key features of functional components?

**Candidate:**
1. **Simple Syntax**: They are essentially JavaScript functions, making them more concise and easier to read.
2. **Hooks**: With Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, functional components can manage state and lifecycle methods similar to class components.
3. **Performance**: They generally have better performance because they do not have the overhead of class instantiation and method binding.
4. **No `this` keyword**: Functional components do not use the `this` keyword, eliminating the confusion caused by its context.
5. **Stateless or Stateful**: Initially, functional components were mostly stateless, but now they can be stateful using Hooks.

**Interviewer:** Great, can you give a basic example of a functional component?

**Candidate:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, `ExampleComponent` is a functional component that utilizes both `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects such as updating the document title.

**Interviewer:** That's a clear and accurate explanation. Thank you!

**Candidate:** You're welcome!
