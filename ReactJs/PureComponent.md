**Interviewer:** Can you explain what Pure Components are in React and how they differ from regular components?

**Candidate:** Of course! In React, a Pure Component is a type of component that implements a shallow comparison on its props and state in the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method. This means that a Pure Component will automatically check if any of its props or state have changed and only re-render if there are changes, which can provide performance benefits by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

Here are some key points:
- **Shallow Comparison:** A Pure Component uses a shallow comparison to determine whether re-rendering is necessary. This means it only compares the first level of changes between props and state.
- **Performance Optimization:** Because of the shallow comparison, Pure Components can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary updates.
- **Implementation:** To create a Pure Component, you can either extend `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component` or use functional components with `React.memo`.

For example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  // Normal Component
}

class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  // Pure Component
}
```

Or with functional components:
```javascript
const MyFunctionalComponent = React.memo((props) => {
  // Functional Pure Component
});
```

**Interviewer:** Great! So when would you choose to use a Pure Component over a regular component?

**Candidate:** Generally, I would choose to use a Pure Component when I know that my component's performance could benefit from avoiding unnecessary re-renders, especially if the component receives a lot of props or has complex state. However, I would be cautious to ensure that the props and state I'm passing are either primitive values or shallow objects. If I am dealing with deeply nested objects or arrays, shallow comparison might not catch changes correctly, and using a Pure Component in such cases could lead to bugs.

Additionally, I might use React.memo for functional components in similar scenarios to achieve the same performance optimizations as a class-based Pure Component.

**Interviewer:** Thatâ€™s a good explanation. Thank you!
