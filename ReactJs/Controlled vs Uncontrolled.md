### **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components in React**  

In React, **controlled** and **uncontrolled** components refer to how form inputs are handled. The key difference is **who controls the state of the input values**:  

| Feature                | **Controlled Components**  | **Uncontrolled Components** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **State Management**   | React controls the input value using state (`useState`). | The DOM controls the input value. |
| **Value Handling**     | Value is set via `value` prop and updated via `onChange` handler. | Value is accessed via `ref` (`useRef`) when needed. |
| **Real-time Updates**  | Updates the state on every input change. | No updates occur unless manually retrieved. |
| **Use Case**           | When you need real-time validation, controlled behavior, or integration with other states. | When you don't need frequent updates or want simpler, native behavior. |
| **Performance**        | Can be less performant with large forms due to frequent re-renders. | More performant as React does not re-render on every keystroke. |

### **Controlled Component Example**
Here, React **fully controls** the input value:  

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function ControlledInput() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={name}
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```
- The `value` prop **binds** the input to `name`.  
- The `onChange` handler **updates** the state when the user types.  

âœ… **Best for:** Validations, form control, and integrating with other state logic.

### **Uncontrolled Component Example**
Here, React **does not control** the input value, and we use a `ref` to retrieve it when needed:  

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
- The input **does not have a `value` prop**.  
- We use `useRef` to **access the value** only when needed.  

âœ… **Best for:** Simple forms, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.  

---

### **When to Use Which?**
- **Use Controlled Components** when you need **instant feedback**, form validation, or state synchronization.  
- **Use Uncontrolled Components** for **simpler forms**, when you only need to read values **on submission**.
