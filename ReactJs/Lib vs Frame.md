### **Library vs. Framework**
Both libraries and frameworks help developers build applications, but they differ in their level of control and how they integrate into a project.

| Feature         | Library | Framework |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **Control** | Developer has full control over how and when to use it. | Framework dictates the structure and flow of the application. |
| **Inversion of Control** | Developer calls the library functions when needed. | Framework calls the developer's code and enforces its architecture (IoC - Inversion of Control). |
| **Scope** | Usually provides specific functionalities (e.g., UI rendering, data fetching). | Provides a complete structure for the application, including routing, state management, and more. |
| **Flexibility** | Can be used alongside other tools with minimal restrictions. | Enforces a predefined way of structuring the application. |

### **Why Angular is a Framework**
Angular is considered a **framework** because:
1. **Inversion of Control (IoC)** – The framework calls your code, rather than the other way around.
2. **Opinionated Structure** – Enforces the use of modules, components, services, and dependency injection.
3. **Complete Solution** – Comes with built-in solutions for routing, state management, forms, HTTP services, and testing.
4. **Tightly Integrated Features** – Includes RxJS for reactive programming and TypeScript by default.

### **Why React is a Library**
React is considered a **library** because:
1. **No Inversion of Control** – You control when and how React components are rendered.
2. **Minimalistic** – React primarily handles UI rendering (the "View" in MVC) and leaves routing, state management, and other concerns to external libraries (e.g., React Router, Redux).
3. **Flexibility** – React can be used in any project alongside other tools without enforcing a strict architecture.
4. **Composable** – It focuses on building reusable UI components but does not dictate the overall structure of the application.

### **Final Verdict**
- **Angular** is a **framework** because it provides a structured, full-fledged solution and controls the flow of the application.
- **React** is a **library** because it focuses only on the UI and allows developers to choose additional tools as needed.
