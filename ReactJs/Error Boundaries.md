Absolutely! Here's how you could confidently answer a question about **Error Boundaries** in an interview:

---

### âœ… **Q: Can you explain what Error Boundaries are in React and when you would use them?**

**A:**  
Yes. **Error Boundaries** are React components that catch **JavaScript errors** in their child component tree **during rendering**, in **lifecycle methods**, and in **constructors** of the whole subtree. Instead of crashing the entire app, they allow us to gracefully handle the error and display a fallback UI.

They do **not** catch errors from:
- Event handlers (we use `try/catch` there),
- Asynchronous code like `setTimeout` or Promises,
- Server-side rendering.

---

### ðŸ§  **Why Use Error Boundaries?**
- To prevent a whole app from crashing due to one componentâ€™s error.
- To show a **custom error message** or recovery option to the user.
- For better **UX** and **debugging**, especially in large, component-driven UIs.

---

### ðŸ“„ **Code Example:**

```tsx
// ErrorBoundary.tsx
import React from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    // Log to monitoring service like Sentry
    console.error("Caught error:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

### Usage:
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

---

### ðŸ”§ Real-World Use Case:
Iâ€™ve used Error Boundaries in production apps when rendering user-generated content. If one widget fails, we isolate the crash and show a fallback instead of breaking the entire page.

---

### ðŸ”š Final Note:
In modern React, especially with large codebases or third-party components, Error Boundaries are essential for **resilience**. They're like a circuit breaker for the UI.

Let me know if you want to see an example combining an Error Boundary with **lazy loading** or **fallback spinners**â€”commonly asked in frontend system design rounds!
