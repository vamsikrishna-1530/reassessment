**Interviewer:** Can you explain the difference between stateful and stateless components in React?

**Candidate:** Certainly! In React, components can be classified into stateful and stateless components based on their use of state.

**Interviewer:** Let's start with stateful components. What are they?

**Candidate:** Stateful components, also known as class components or stateful functional components using hooks, manage their own state. They are used to hold and manage data that can change over time. These components can fetch data, respond to user inputs, and update their state to reflect new information. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown:

- **Typically Class-Based or Use Hooks:** Originally, stateful components were class components, but with the introduction of hooks, functional components can also be stateful.
- **Manages Local State:** They have a state object to store their dynamic data and use `this.setState` or the `useState` hook to update it.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Class components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` to handle side effects.

**Interviewer:** And what about stateless components?

**Candidate:** Stateless components, also known as functional or presentational components, do not manage their own state. They are mainly used for rendering UI and depend wholly on the props passed to them to display data. The key points are:

- **Functional Components:** They are usually written as functional components, but with React 16.8 and later, hooks enable them to manage state if needed.
- **No Local State:** They do not have a `state` object or lifecycle methods associated with them.
- **Pure Functions:** Typically, these components are pure functions that take props and return JSX.

**Interviewer:** Can you quickly summarize the main difference?

**Candidate:** Absolutely! The main difference is that stateful components manage their own state and lifecycle, making them suitable for handling dynamic data and side effects. Stateless components, on the other hand, rely on props and are primarily used for rendering static content regardless of mutations in the application's state.
