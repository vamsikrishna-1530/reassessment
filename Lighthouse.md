Great question ‚Äî here‚Äôs how you can answer it **as a candidate in an interview**, clearly and professionally:

---

### ‚úÖ **Q: What is Lighthouse and how does it work?**

**A (Candidate):**  
Lighthouse is an **open-source tool** developed by Google that helps developers audit the **quality of their web applications**. It checks for key areas like:

- **Performance**
- **Accessibility**
- **Best Practices**
- **SEO**
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) compliance**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works:**

Lighthouse runs a series of **automated audits** on a web page, either:
- Through **Chrome DevTools**,
- From the **command line** (`npx lighthouse`),
- Or via **CI tools** (like GitHub Actions or Lighthouse CI).

It loads the page in a **headless Chrome instance**, simulates a real user experience, and then scores each category on a scale from 0 to 100.

For example:
- **Accessibility audits** check for things like missing alt attributes, low contrast, keyboard traps, ARIA misuse, and landmark usage.
- **Performance** looks at metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Time to Interactive (TTI), and Total Blocking Time (TBT).
- **Best practices** catch things like HTTP issues, unsafe links, or JavaScript errors.

---

### üí° **In My Workflow:**

I use Lighthouse regularly during development and staging reviews. In a recent Next.js project, we used it to:
- Detect missing form labels and contrast issues (a11y),
- Optimize image formats and lazy loading (performance),
- Validate semantic structure for SEO.

I also integrate Lighthouse into CI/CD so it runs automatically on every PR ‚Äî especially for regression checks on accessibility.

---

### üîö Final Note:
Lighthouse helps catch issues early, and because it's based on real-world standards like **WCAG**, **Core Web Vitals**, and **SEO guidelines**, it‚Äôs a great tool for delivering polished, accessible, and performant apps ‚Äî especially in client-facing roles.
