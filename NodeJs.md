### **Deep Dive into the Node.js Event Loop**  

The **Node.js Event Loop** is the core mechanism that enables **asynchronous, non-blocking operations**. It allows JavaScript to run **single-threaded** while efficiently handling multiple concurrent operations.  

---

## **1. What is the Event Loop?**  
- In Node.js, **everything runs inside the event loop**.  
- It is responsible for handling **asynchronous operations** like:  
  - I/O operations (e.g., file system, network requests)  
  - Timers (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`)  
  - Promises and async/await  
  - Callbacks and event listeners  
- It continuously checks if there are **pending tasks**, processes them, and moves on to the next task.  

---

## **2. How Does the Event Loop Work Step by Step?**  

The event loop executes in **phases**, and each phase has a specific role:  

### **Step 1: Timers Phase**
- Executes **scheduled callbacks** for expired timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`).  
- Example:  
  ```js
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer Callback"), 1000);
  ```  
- If the timer expires, the callback is added to the **callback queue** and executed in the next iteration of the event loop.  

---

### **Step 2: I/O Callbacks Phase**  
- Executes **callbacks for I/O operations** (e.g., file system, network requests).  
- Example:  
  ```js
  const fs = require("fs");
  fs.readFile("file.txt", (err, data) => {
      console.log("File Read Completed");
  });
  ```  
- Once `readFile` completes, its callback is executed in this phase.  

---

### **Step 3: Idle & Prepare Phase** *(Internal Use Only)*  
- Used for **internal operations** by Node.js (e.g., preparing for the next cycle).  
- Developers generally don‚Äôt interact with this phase.  

---

### **Step 4: Poll Phase**  
- The **core phase of the Event Loop** where:  
  1. It **fetches new I/O events** (e.g., network requests, database queries).  
  2. If there are **pending I/O callbacks**, they are executed.  
  3. If there are **no pending I/O callbacks**, it checks for timers.  

- Example (Fetching API Data):  
  ```js
  const https = require("https");

  https.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", (res) => {
      console.log("Data Fetched from API");
  });
  ```  
- Once data is received, its callback is executed in the **poll phase**.  

---

### **Step 5: Check Phase (Immediate Callbacks)**  
- Executes **setImmediate()** callbacks.  
- **setImmediate()** is similar to `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)`, but it runs **after the poll phase**.  

- Example:  
  ```js
  setImmediate(() => console.log("SetImmediate Callback"));
  ```  

- If there are no pending I/O operations, `setImmediate()` runs before `setTimeout()`.  

---

### **Step 6: Close Callbacks Phase**  
- Executes **cleanup callbacks** for closed connections (e.g., sockets, streams).  
- Example:  
  ```js
  const net = require("net");
  const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
      socket.end("Goodbye!\n");
  });

  server.on("close", () => console.log("Server Closed"));
  server.close();
  ```  
- Once the server closes, the **"close" event** triggers in this phase.  

---

## **3. Example: How Tasks Are Executed in the Event Loop**  

Let‚Äôs analyze how tasks run inside the **event loop** with a real example:  

```js
const fs = require("fs");

setTimeout(() => console.log("1. setTimeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("2. setImmediate"));

fs.readFile("file.txt", () => {
    console.log("3. File Read Complete");
    setTimeout(() => console.log("4. setTimeout inside readFile"), 0);
    setImmediate(() => console.log("5. setImmediate inside readFile"));
});

console.log("6. Synchronous Code");
```

### **Execution Order:**  
1. **Synchronous Code Runs First**  
   - `"6. Synchronous Code"`  

2. **Timers & setImmediate() Go to Respective Queues**  
   - `setTimeout()` (Timers Phase)  
   - `setImmediate()` (Check Phase)  

3. **File Read (Async I/O Operation) is Triggered**  
   - Moves to the **Poll Phase** and waits for completion.  

4. **Event Loop Executes:**
   - If the poll phase has no pending tasks, `setImmediate()` runs first:
     - `"2. setImmediate"`
   - Then, the timers phase runs:
     - `"1. setTimeout"`

5. **File Read Completes, Callbacks Execute:**  
   - `"3. File Read Complete"`
   - Inside file read callback:
     - `setTimeout()` ‚Üí (Goes to Timers Phase)
     - `setImmediate()` ‚Üí (Goes to Check Phase)

6. **Next Event Loop Iteration:**
   - `"5. setImmediate inside readFile"`
   - `"4. setTimeout inside readFile"`

### **Final Output:**
```
6. Synchronous Code
2. setImmediate
1. setTimeout
3. File Read Complete
5. setImmediate inside readFile
4. setTimeout inside readFile
```

## **4. How Event Loop Handles Promises & Async/Await?**  

- **Promises & Async/Await** are handled in the **Microtask Queue**, which has **higher priority** than the event loop phases.  

Example:  
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise Resolved"));

console.log("End");
```

### **Execution Order:**  
1. `"Start"`
2. `"End"`
3. `"Promise Resolved"` (Microtask Queue)
4. `"setTimeout"` (Timers Phase)

### **Output:**
```
Start
End
Promise Resolved
setTimeout
```

## **5. Event Loop Pros and Cons**  

### **Pros:**
‚úÖ **Handles multiple requests efficiently** without creating multiple threads.  
‚úÖ **Ideal for real-time applications** (e.g., chat apps, streaming).  
‚úÖ **Single-threaded model avoids context switching overhead** in multi-threaded systems.  

### **Cons:**  
‚ùå **Not suitable for CPU-heavy tasks** (e.g., video processing, complex computations).  
‚ùå **Requires careful async handling** (e.g., race conditions, unhandled promise rejections).  
‚ùå **Blocking code (e.g., while loops) can freeze the entire application**.
