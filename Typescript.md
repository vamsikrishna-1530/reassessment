Since your reassessment feedback highlights gaps in **TypeScript fundamentals and advanced features**, here are some **key questions and answers** to help strengthen your knowledge for the **A3 Senior Software Engineer (React.js, JavaScript Engineering) promotion**.

### **Q1: What is the difference between `any` and `unknown` in TypeScript?**  

**Answer:**  
Both `any` and `unknown` can hold values of any type, but they have key differences in how they are used:  

| Feature | `any` | `unknown` |
|---------|------|----------|
| Type Safety | No type checking; disables TypeScript‚Äôs type system. | Type-safe; requires type checking before usage. |
| Assignability | Can be assigned to any type. | Can only be assigned after type checking. |
| Best Use Case | When migrating from JavaScript (avoid if possible). | When handling dynamic types safely (e.g., API responses). |

**Example:**  

```typescript
let a: any = "Hello";
a.toUpperCase(); // ‚úÖ No error, but risky!

let u: unknown = "Hello";
u.toUpperCase(); // ‚ùå Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.

if (typeof u === "string") {
  u.toUpperCase(); // ‚úÖ Now safe!
}
```

**Pros of `any` and `unknown`:**  
‚úÖ `any`: Flexibility when working with dynamic data or quick prototyping.  
‚úÖ `unknown`: Safer alternative to `any`, ensuring proper type validation.  

**Cons of `any` and `unknown`:**  
‚ùå `any`: Bypasses TypeScript‚Äôs type safety, increasing the risk of runtime errors.  
‚ùå `unknown`: Requires explicit type checks before use, adding verbosity.

### **Q2: What is the difference between `type` and `interface` in TypeScript?**  

**Answer:**  
Both `type` and `interface` are used for defining object structures, but they have key differences:  

| Feature | `type` | `interface` |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Extensibility | Cannot be extended with `extends` but can use intersection (`&`). | Can be extended using `extends`. |
| Declaration Merging | Does not support declaration merging. | Supports declaration merging (multiple declarations merge). |
| Performance | Slightly faster at compile time. | Slightly slower due to merging complexity. |
| Best Use Case | Union types, complex mappings. | Defining reusable, extendable structures. |

**Example:**  

```typescript
// Using `interface`
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  role: string;
}

// Using `type`
type PersonType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type EmployeeType = PersonType & { role: string };
```

**Pros of `interface` and `type`:**  
‚úÖ **`interface`**: Supports merging, better for OOP-style design.  
‚úÖ **`type`**: More flexible (e.g., union types, mapped types).  

**Cons of `interface` and `type`:**  
‚ùå **`interface`**: Cannot define union types.  
‚ùå **`type`**: Cannot be merged across multiple declarations.

### **Q3: What are the benefits and drawbacks of using TypeScript in a React.js project?**  

**Answer:**  

‚úÖ **Pros of TypeScript in React.js:**  
- **Type Safety:** Catches errors at compile-time, reducing runtime issues.  
- **Better IDE Support:** Autocompletion, inline documentation, and type hints.  
- **Scalability:** Helps maintain large codebases with clear interfaces and types.  
- **Refactoring Ease:** Changes propagate across the codebase with minimal risk.  
- **Self-documenting Code:** Type definitions act as inline documentation.  

‚ùå **Cons of TypeScript in React.js:**  
- **Learning Curve:** Developers with a JavaScript background need time to adapt.  
- **Boilerplate Overhead:** Requires more setup and annotations, increasing initial complexity.  
- **Compilation Overhead:** TypeScript code needs to be transpiled, adding a build step.  
- **Strictness Can Be Frustrating:** Sometimes requires unnecessary type assertions, slowing down development.

### **Q4: What are utility types in TypeScript, and how do they help in React.js development?**  

**Answer:**  
TypeScript provides **utility types** to manipulate existing types more efficiently. Common ones used in React.js:  

| Utility Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| `Partial<T>` | Makes all properties optional. | `Partial<{ name: string; age: number }>` ‚Üí `{ name?: string; age?: number }` |
| `Readonly<T>` | Prevents modification of object properties. | `Readonly<{ name: string }>` ‚Üí `{ readonly name: string }` |
| `Pick<T, K>` | Selects only specific keys from an object. | `Pick<User, "name" | "email">` |
| `Omit<T, K>` | Excludes specific keys from an object. | `Omit<User, "password">` |
| `Record<K, T>` | Creates an object type with specific keys. | `Record<string, number>` ‚Üí `{ [key: string]: number }` |
| `ReturnType<T>` | Extracts return type of a function. | `ReturnType<typeof getUser>` ‚Üí `User` |

**Example in React.js:**  

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

// Pick only necessary fields for displaying user info
type PublicUser = Pick<User, "id" | "name" | "email">;

// Prevent modifying an object
const user: Readonly<User> = { id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", password: "secret" };
user.name = "Bob"; // ‚ùå Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

**Pros of Utility Types:**  
‚úÖ Reduce boilerplate code.  
‚úÖ Improve reusability by deriving new types from existing ones.  
‚úÖ Enforce stricter type constraints while keeping flexibility.  

**Cons of Utility Types:**  
‚ùå Can become **complex** when overused.  
‚ùå Some advanced utilities may be **hard to debug**.

### **Q5: What are mapped types in TypeScript, and how can they be useful in a React.js project?**  

**Answer:**  
Mapped types allow us to transform properties of an existing type dynamically.  

**Example:**  

```typescript
// Convert all properties of a type to optional
type Partial<T> = { [K in keyof T]?: T[K] };

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type OptionalUser = Partial<User>; // { id?: number; name?: string; email?: string; }
```

**Use Case in React:**  
- Define reusable component prop types with flexibility.  
- Create variations of existing types dynamically.  

**Pros of Mapped Types:**  
‚úÖ Helps in creating **reusable and scalable** types.  
‚úÖ Reduces redundancy by avoiding repeated type definitions.  

**Cons of Mapped Types:**  
‚ùå Can be **tricky to debug** if deeply nested.  
‚ùå Not always intuitive for **beginners**.
